### 1.7

???+ question
    List four significant differences between a file-processing system and a DBMS.

??? note "answer"
    1. A file-processing system is more specific to the problem at hand while a DBMS is more general. A file-processing system used by a university is difficult to use in a hospital setting. While a DBMS once written can be used in different places.

    2. It is difficult to ensure atomicity in a conventional file-processing system while it is a lot easier in a DBMS. Often wrapping a set of SQL statements in a "BEGIN TRANSACTION" and "END TRANSACTION" are often enough in the relational DBMS world.
    
    3. Protecting against concurrent-access anomalies in a file-processing system is difficult. Using a DBMS is much easier to protect against concurrent-access anomalies.
    
    4. Most DBMS have a concept of a user and what access that user has. Enforcing such authorization in a file-processing system is really difficult.

???+ question
    Explain the concept of physical data independence and its importance in database systems.

??? note "answer[(üìùPhysical level)](https://melody12020831.github.io/Notebook/Computer_Science/DB/Chapter1/#Physicallevel) [(üìùPhysical data independence)](https://melody12020831.github.io/Notebook/Computer_Science/DB/Chapter1/#Physicaldataindependence)"
    There are 3 levels of data abstraction in a database: Physical Level, Logical Level and View Level. Physical data independence is the abstraction provided by the Logical Level to hide the complex data-structures that are used at the Physical Level to retrieve data efficiently.

    > **Physical level**: The lowest level of abstraction describes how the data are actually stored. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.
    
    > **Physical data independence**: the ability to modify the physical schema without changing the logical schema. 
    
    > *from DeepSeek*: Physical data independence is a fundamental principle in database systems that enhances flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. By decoupling the physical storage details from the logical data representation, it allows for efficient management and optimization of data storage without impacting the applications that rely on the database. This separation is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable database systems.

### 1.9

???+ question
    List five responsibilities of a database-management system. For each responsibility, explain the problems that would arise if the responsibility were not discharged.

??? note "answer[(üìùCharacteristics)](https://melody12020831.github.io/Notebook/Computer_Science/DB/Chapter1/#Characteristics)"
    1. Security - Since DBMS have the concept of a ROLE (user) it easier for setting access managmenent.

    2. Needs to offer atomicity when needed - If atomicity is not provided, inconsistency will be inevitable.
    
    3. Needs to offer a simple and efficient way to query data
    
    4. Needs to offer durability i.e. once an update or an insert has happened it must be persisted.
    
    5. A DBMS needs to offer a way for protection against concurrent-access anomalies.

### 1.15 

???+ question
    Describe at least three tables that might be used to store information in a socialnetworking system such as Facebook.

??? note "answer"
    1. Users table - that contains id, full name, phone number, email, date of birth, profile pic

    2. Chats table - that contains the chat
    
    3. Friends table - that contains basically two columns of user ids (foreign keys from Users table)
